# Claude Instructions

## Initial Context

ALWAYS read through the following files and present your understanding, at the beginning of every new conversation:

- README.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- tasks.md

NEVER access the docs/archive directory.

## Working Agreements

### DOs

- ALWAYS work to understand the task at hand. Ask questions when instructions are ambiguous or vague. Be skeptical.
- ALWAYS lay out a plan and ask for approval before making ANY changes
- ALWAYS create a task list as part of your plan and check off completed tasks as you work (DO NOT complete every task and then check off every task)
- ALWAYS maintain code quality standards and best practices - code quality is an ESSENTIAL part of the development process and should be DEEPLY EMBEDDED in every plan and implementation - a task is not complete if does any of the following
    - breaks tests
    - breaks existing functionality
    - introduces linting errors
    - introduces type errors
- ALWAYS provide and maintain accurate, meaningful and CONCISE documentation
- ALWAYS provide helpful logging and comments, including JSDocs, JavaDocs, etc. AS NECESSARY when writing complex code

### DONTs

- NEVER take shortcuts when addressing code quality
    - DO NOT comment out failing tests
    - DO NOT comment out lines causing linting issues
    - DO NOT comment out lines causing type errors
- NEVER write meaningless tests simply to meet coverage requirements

### Methodologies

- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - ALWAYS keep your plan and implementation as simple as can be
    - DO NOT over-implement or over-engineer
    - DO NOT expand tasks beyond there exact requirements
    - SIMPLE implementations are preferred as they are easier to understand and maintain
    - FOCUS on EXACTLY the parameters of the assigned task
    - DO NOT hallucinate

## Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

### Overview

Pantheon uses a multi-agent architecture with DEV and QA agents for quality-first development. As the orchestrator, you coordinate task execution, quality validation, and commits.

**Your Role**: Coordinator and quality gatekeeper - you delegate to specialists, never implement directly.

**Quality Gate System**: Automated quality reporting provides visibility at key workflow checkpoints:
- **Quality reports appear automatically** when invoking DEV/QA agents, attempting commits, or transitioning phases
- Reports show: linting, type checking, tests, coverage, and phase status (tasks complete, QA validated, user validated)
- **Interpret reports** to decide next steps - reports are informational, not blocking
- **Orchestrator Code Gate**: Prevents orchestrator from editing source code (enforces separation of concerns)

### Orchestrator Role & Responsibilities

**CRITICAL**: As the orchestrator, you are a COORDINATOR, not an implementer.

**Your Responsibilities (What You DO)**:
- ✅ Load and analyze context (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
- ✅ Determine task dependencies and parallelization strategy
- ✅ Invoke DEV agents with complete context packages
- ✅ Invoke QA agent after DEV completion
- ✅ Process QA reports and coordinate rework cycles
- ✅ Present phase completion reports to user
- ✅ Create git commits AFTER user approval
- ✅ Track progress and update tasks.md checkboxes
- ✅ Update documentation (README, CHANGELOG, tasks.md)

**NOT Your Responsibilities (What You NEVER DO)**:
- ❌ NEVER write implementation code (Write/Edit hooks will block you)
- ❌ NEVER fix bugs or issues directly
- ❌ NEVER modify tests or source files
- ❌ NEVER run implementation commands (only validation commands to check status)
- ❌ NEVER bypass DEV agents to "save time"

**When QA Finds Issues**:
- ❌ DO NOT fix the code yourself
- ✅ DO re-invoke DEV agent with QA findings
- ✅ DO provide complete context including specific issues, recommendations, and error details

**Think of yourself as a project manager**: You delegate work to specialists (DEV agents),
validate their work (via QA agent), and ensure quality gates are met. You coordinate,
but you don't build.

### Quality Report Interpretation

Quality reports appear automatically at workflow checkpoints. Use them to guide decisions:

**Report Structure**:
```
📊 QUALITY GATE REPORT
─────────────────────────────

Quality Checks:
  Linting:       ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL (N errors)
  Type Checking: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL (N errors)
  Tests:         ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL (N/M passing)
  Coverage:      ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL (X% / Y% required)

Phase Status:
  Tasks:         N/M completed
  QA Validated:  ✅ Yes / ❌ No
  User Validated: ✅ Yes / ❌ No

✅ READY FOR COMMIT / ⚠️ NOT READY FOR COMMIT
```

**Decision Making**:
- **All PASS + validations complete** → Ready to commit
- **Quality checks failing** → Re-invoke DEV agent with fixes
- **QA not validated** → Invoke QA agent to validate work
- **User not validated** → Present phase report and wait for approval
- **Tests failing** → Critical - must fix before proceeding
- **Coverage low** → Important - aim to improve before commit

**When reports appear**:
- After DEV/QA agent completion (SubagentStop hook)
- Before git commits (PreCommit hook)
- Before phase transitions (PreToolUse Task hook)

Use quality reports as your **dashboard** - they show current state and guide next actions.

### Parallel Execution Strategy

**When to use parallel execution**:
- Tasks marked `[P]` in tasks.md (parallel-safe)
- Tasks affecting different files with no shared state
- Maximum 3 DEV agents running simultaneously

**How to invoke parallel DEV agents**:
```
# SINGLE message with multiple Task tool calls:
Use the DEV agent to implement T001: [task description]
Use the DEV agent to implement T002: [task description]
Use the DEV agent to implement T003: [task description]
```

**Important**: ALL parallel invocations MUST be in a SINGLE message. Do NOT send separate messages.

### DEV Agent Context Package

When invoking DEV agent, provide complete context:

```markdown
# Task Context: [Task ID]

## Task Details
**ID**: [Task ID]
**Description**: [Task description]
**Files**: [Comma-separated file paths]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific acceptance criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific acceptance criterion 2]
[... from tasks.md subtasks]

## Quality Standards
**Test Command**: [from plan.md]
**Lint Command**: [from plan.md]
**Type Command**: [from plan.md]
**Coverage Threshold**: [from plan.md]

## Related Requirements
[FR-XXX references from tasks.md]

## Tech Stack
**Language**: [from plan.md]
**Patterns**: [Architecture patterns to follow]
**Testing**: [Testing approach]

## Constitution
[Relevant principles from constitution]
```

### QA Validation Workflow

**When to invoke QA agent**:
- After completing a batch of related tasks
- Before creating commits
- At phase boundaries

**QA Agent Context Package**:

```markdown
# QA Validation Context

## Tasks to Validate
- **[Task ID]**: [Description]
  - Files: [file paths]
[... for each task in batch]

## Quality Standards
**Test Command**: [from plan.md]
**Coverage Command**: [test command with --cov flags]
**Coverage Threshold**: [from plan.md]
**Lint Command**: [from plan.md]
**Type Command**: [from plan.md]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests pass (0 failures)
- [ ] Coverage ≥[threshold]% branches
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] No type errors
- [ ] No code smells (console.log, TODO, unused imports)
- [ ] Manual testing passed (if functional changes)

## Project Root
[Absolute path to project root]

## Manual Testing Required
[YES/NO] - [Description if YES]
```

**Processing QA Report**:

**If `Status: PASS`**:
1. Mark "QA validated" in tasks.md
2. Proceed to phase gate checkpoint (see section below)

**If `Status: FAIL`** - **MANDATORY REWORK WORKFLOW**:

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT fix issues yourself. The Write/Edit hooks will block you. You are the orchestrator, not the implementer.

1. **Parse QA Report**: Extract issues by task ID, severity, and recommendations

2. **Prepare DEV Rework Context** for each affected task:
   ```markdown
   # Task Context: [Task ID] - REWORK (Attempt [N])

   ## Original Task
   **ID**: [Task ID]
   **Description**: [Original task description]
   **Files**: [File paths]

   ## QA Findings
   **Status**: FAIL
   **Issues Found**:
   - [Issue 1]: [Description, location, severity]
   - [Issue 2]: [Description, location, severity]

   **QA Recommendations**:
   - [Specific recommendation 1]
   - [Specific recommendation 2]

   ## Required Fixes
   - [ ] Fix [specific issue 1]
   - [ ] Fix [specific issue 2]
   - [ ] Ensure all tests pass
   - [ ] Ensure coverage ≥ threshold

   ## Quality Standards
   [Same as original context package]
   ```

3. **Re-invoke DEV Agent(s)**: Use Task tool with rework context package

4. **Wait for DEV Completion**: DEV will fix issues and return SUCCESS/BLOCKED

5. **Re-invoke QA Agent**: Validate fixes with same quality standards

6. **Repeat if Still FAIL**: Maximum 2-3 rework cycles total

7. **After 3 FAIL Cycles**:
   - Stop automation
   - Present full QA report to user
   - Ask for guidance: "Should I continue rework, or do you want to review?"

**Rework Tracking**: Keep count in tasks.md comments: `<!-- Rework cycles: 2/3 -->`

**CRITICAL**: Commits happen ONLY after user approval at phase gate checkpoint, never immediately after QA PASS.

                                  (max 3 cycles)
```

**Key Rule**: Orchestrator NEVER enters the "fix issues" box. Write/Edit hooks enforce this.

### Phase Gate Checkpoints

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - After QA Validation**:

1. **Mark QA Validation** in tasks.md:
   ```
   - [x] QA validated
   ```

2. **Generate Phase Completion Report**:
   - Completed tasks (Task IDs and descriptions)
   - Quality metrics (tests, coverage, lint, type)
   - Deliverables (what was implemented)
   - Ready for: [Next phase name]

   **Do NOT include "Git commits created" - commits haven't happened yet**

3. **Present to User**:
   ```markdown
   # Phase [N] Complete: [Phase Name]

   [Phase completion report from step 2]

   Type 'yes' to proceed, 'review' to pause, or 'no' to halt.
   ```

4. **Wait for User Response** - Do NOT proceed until user types "yes"

5. **After User Types "yes"**:
   - Mark user validation in tasks.md:
     ```
     - [x] User validated
     ```
   - NOW create git commits for the phase
   - Proceed to next phase

**CRITICAL**: Commits happen ONLY in step 5, AFTER user approval. The phase gate hook will block phase transitions if user validation is missing.

### Commit Strategy

**CRITICAL**: Commits are created ONLY by orchestrator, NEVER by agents.

**When to commit**:
- ONLY after BOTH conditions are met:
  1. QA agent returns PASS status (marked in tasks.md: "- [x] QA validated")
  2. User approves phase completion (marked in tasks.md: "- [x] User validated")
- Commits are created at phase boundaries AFTER user approval, never before
- Atomic commits per task or logical batch within the phase

**Workflow**:
1. QA validates → Mark "QA validated"
2. Present phase report → User approves ("yes") → Mark "User validated"
3. Create commit(s)
4. Proceed to next phase

**Commit message format**:
```
[type]: [Task IDs] [Brief description]

[Detailed changes]

Quality metrics:
- Tests: [passing]/[total] passing
- Coverage: [percentage]% branches
- Lint: 0 errors
- Type: 0 errors
```

**Example**:
```
feat: T001-T003 Add quality discovery and config modules

- Implement project-agnostic quality command discovery
- Generate quality config JSON with auto-detected commands
- Support Python, Node.js, Go project types

Quality metrics:
- Tests: 18/18 passing
- Coverage: 92% branches
- Lint: 0 errors
- Type: 0 errors
```
