## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Project Context

**Current State** (Pantheon v0.1.x):
- Single DEV agent executes tasks sequentially
- No independent quality validation
- Soft quality enforcement (suggestions, not requirements)
- No user checkpoints between phases
- Benchmark Test-1 Score: **67.5/100** with 43 failing tests

**Target State** (Pantheon v0.2.0):
- Multi-agent architecture with independent DEV and QA agents
- Parallel task execution (up to 3 simultaneous DEV agents)
- Deterministic quality enforcement via hooks
- Automatic user checkpoints with validation
- Benchmark Test-2 Target Score: **85+/100** with 0 failing tests

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: The current spec describes updating `/implement` command integration with "multi-agent workflow guidance" but your clarification emphasizes keeping Spec Kit changes minimal. Which integration approach should we take? ‚Üí A: Use existing "## Agent Integration" section in /implement command (minimal updates only). Add orchestrator workflow instructions to CLAUDE.md instead of expanding Spec Kit command directives.

- Q: When should the system discover and create `.pantheon/quality-config.json`? ‚Üí A: Run quality discovery when `/constitution` command executes (aligns with project setup and constitution creation).

- Q: Where should hook script files be installed? ‚Üí A: Hook scripts in .pantheon/hooks/, configuration references in .claude/settings.json

- Q: When should the QA agent perform manual testing? ‚Üí A: Always required for functional changes (frontend/backend). Skip only for non-functional tasks (documentation, config-only).

- Q: When executing 3 DEV agents in parallel, what should happen if one fails/blocks while others succeed? ‚Üí A: Wait for all to complete, accept successful ones, retry only failed agent(s), then proceed to QA once all succeed.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a **software developer using Pantheon with GitHub Spec Kit**, I need the system to implement features with guaranteed quality, parallel efficiency, and phase-by-phase validation so that I can confidently deliver production-ready code without accumulating technical debt or silent test failures.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Parallel Task Execution
**Given** I have a phase with 5 independent tasks with no dependencies
**When** the orchestrator analyzes the task list
**Then** the system groups tasks into batches of maximum 3 parallel executions
**And** invokes multiple DEV agents simultaneously in a single message
**And** waits for all DEV agents to complete before proceeding to validation

#### Scenario 2: Quality Validation with QA Agent
**Given** all DEV agents in a batch have completed their tasks (with functional code changes)
**When** the orchestrator invokes the QA agent
**Then** the QA agent runs all automated quality checks (tests, coverage, linting, type checking)
**And** performs manual functional testing (UI verification for frontend, API/data flow testing for backend)
**And** analyzes results to identify failures, coverage gaps, code smells, and functional issues
**And** links issues to specific tasks
**And** returns a structured report with PASS or FAIL status and actionable recommendations

#### Scenario 3: Quality Gate Enforcement via Hooks
**Given** a DEV agent claims task completion
**When** the SubagentStop hook executes
**Then** the hook runs actual quality commands (tests, lint, type check)
**And** searches for code smells (console.log, TODO comments, debugger statements)
**And** blocks the agent completion if any violations found
**And** provides clear error messages for the agent to fix

#### Scenario 4: QA Feedback Loop
**Given** the QA agent returns FAIL with specific issues
**When** the orchestrator processes the QA report
**Then** the system re-invokes specific DEV agents with issue details
**And** DEV agents fix the identified problems
**And** the QA agent validates again
**And** the loop continues until PASS or 3 attempts reached

#### Scenario 5: Phase Gate with User Checkpoint
**Given** all tasks in a phase have been completed and validated
**When** the orchestrator presents a phase completion report
**Then** the system waits for user approval before proceeding
**And** when the user approves, the phase gate hook automatically validates quality
**And** if validation fails, the system blocks phase transition and reports issues
**And** if validation passes, the system proceeds to the next phase

#### Scenario 6: Orchestrator Commits After Validation
**Given** the QA agent returns PASS for a batch of tasks
**When** the orchestrator creates a git commit
**Then** the PreCommit hook runs all quality checks before allowing the commit
**And** if checks fail, the commit is blocked with clear error messages
**And** if checks pass, the commit is created with a descriptive message including quality metrics

#### Scenario 7: Project-Agnostic Quality Discovery
**Given** a new project initialized with Pantheon (Node.js, Python, Go, or other tech stack)
**When** the orchestrator runs for the first time
**Then** the system analyzes the project structure (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, etc.)
**And** discovers quality commands from plan.md if specified
**And** auto-discovers commands if not in plan.md
**And** creates .pantheon/quality-config.json with discovered commands
**And** all agents and hooks read from this config file

#### Scenario 8: DEV Agent Blocked Status
**Given** a DEV agent attempts a subtask 3 times but verification keeps failing
**When** the agent reaches the failure threshold
**Then** the agent stops implementation
**And** documents the blocker clearly (what was attempted, why it's blocked, what's needed)
**And** returns status BLOCKED to the orchestrator
**And** the orchestrator halts execution and reports to the user for guidance

### Edge Cases

#### Edge Case 1: All DEV Agents Complete but QA Fails
**What happens when** all DEV agents report SUCCESS but QA identifies critical failures?
- System does NOT mark tasks complete
- System does NOT create commits
- System re-invokes specific DEV agents with QA findings
- Loop continues until PASS (max 3 QA validation cycles)
- After 3 failures, system halts and waits for user guidance

#### Edge Case 2: SubagentStop Hook Blocks DEV Completion
**What happens when** DEV agent claims completion but hook finds violations (console.log, failing tests)?
- Hook blocks the agent with exit code 2
- Agent receives clear error message about specific violations
- Agent must fix issues before completion accepted
- Hook runs again after fixes until pass

#### Edge Case 3: Phase Gate Hook Blocks Phase Transition
**What happens when** user approves phase transition but automated validation fails?
- Phase gate hook blocks with exit code 2
- User sees error message: "Phase gate validation failed - tests/lint/coverage not passing"
- Phase does NOT transition
- User must review and fix issues before proceeding

#### Edge Case 4: Dependency Chain Requires Sequential Execution
**What happens when** tasks have dependencies that prevent full parallelization?
- Orchestrator analyzes dependency graph from tasks.md
- Groups only independent tasks for parallel execution
- Executes dependent tasks sequentially after prerequisites complete
- Example: T001 (no deps) + T004 (no deps) parallel, then T002 (depends on T001) sequentially

#### Edge Case 5: PreCommit Hook Fails After QA Pass
**What happens when** code passes QA validation but fails PreCommit hook (e.g., tests regressed between QA and commit)?
- PreCommit hook blocks commit with exit code 2
- Orchestrator sees commit blocked with error details
- System must re-run QA validation to identify new issues
- Prevents degraded code from being committed

#### Edge Case 6: Quality Config Discovery Fails
**What happens when** project structure is ambiguous and plan.md doesn't specify quality commands?
- System creates .pantheon/quality-config.json with empty commands
- Hooks and QA agent skip checks that have no command specified
- User receives warning: "Quality commands not discovered - specify in plan.md"
- Workflow continues but with reduced validation coverage

#### Edge Case 7: No Independent Tasks for Parallelization
**What happens when** all tasks in a phase have dependencies (no parallel opportunities)?
- Orchestrator executes tasks sequentially (1 DEV agent at a time)
- QA validation still runs after each task or small batches
- No performance benefit from parallelization in this phase
- Workflow correctness maintained

#### Edge Case 8: Partial Batch Failure (Mixed Success/Failure)
**What happens when** 3 DEV agents run in parallel but 1 fails/blocks while 2 succeed?
- Orchestrator waits for all 3 agents to complete
- Preserves successful work from the 2 passing agents (no re-execution)
- Re-invokes only the 1 failed agent with error details
- Failed agent attempts fix (up to 3 total attempts)
- Once failed agent succeeds, proceeds to QA validation for entire batch
- If failed agent reaches 3 failures, halts and reports to user for guidance

- **FR-065**: System MUST provide new QA agent specification (qa.md) with complete workflow, context package format, report structure, and guardrails

- **FR-066**: QA agent specification MUST be project-agnostic (no hardcoded commands like "npm test")

#### Spec Kit Integration

- **FR-067**: System MUST update existing "## Agent Integration" section in /implement command with minimal directive about using DEV and QA agents

- **FR-068**: Updates to /implement command MUST be minimal (only enhance existing Agent Integration section, no new sections or structural changes)

- **FR-069**: Integration MUST preserve all existing Spec Kit functionality and command logic

- **FR-070**: System MUST add comprehensive workflow orchestration instructions to CLAUDE.md (not in Spec Kit commands) covering: parallel execution strategy, QA validation workflow, phase gates, commit strategy, and context package formats

---

### Key Entities

- **QA Agent**: Independent validation specialist sub-agent with focused context for comprehensive quality validation. Receives batch of completed tasks, runs all automated quality checks (tests, coverage, lint, type-check), performs manual functional testing (frontend UI verification, backend API/data flow validation), analyzes results, links issues to tasks, generates structured reports, returns PASS/FAIL status. Has read-only access (no code modification). Manual testing required for all functional changes (code); may be skipped for non-functional tasks (documentation). Uses tools: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, MCP browser, Playwright MCP.

- **Quality Config**: Project-specific configuration file (.pantheon/quality-config.json) containing discovered quality commands for tests, coverage, linting, type checking, and build. Single source of truth for all agents and hooks. Created by orchestrator during first execution. Supports any tech stack (Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, etc.).

- **SubagentStop Hook**: Shell script (.pantheon/hooks/subagent-validation.sh) that executes when DEV or QA agents complete. Validates agent output before returning to orchestrator. For DEV: verifies tests pass, linting passes, type checking passes, no console.log/TODO/debugger. For QA: verifies all quality checks executed. Blocks with exit code 2 if validation fails.

- **PreCommit Hook**: Shell script (.pantheon/hooks/pre-commit-gate.sh) that executes before every git commit. Runs comprehensive quality suite (tests, lint, type-check, coverage). Blocks commits with exit code 2 if any check fails. Final quality gate before code committed.

- **Phase Gate Hook**: Shell script (.pantheon/hooks/phase-gate.sh) that executes automatically when user approves phase transition. Validates all quality checks pass before allowing phase to proceed. Blocks with exit code 2 if validation fails. Ensures phases don't transition with incomplete work.

- **Context Package**: Structured data bundle passed from orchestrator to DEV or QA agents. For DEV: includes task ID, description, files, acceptance criteria, quality standards, requirements, tech stack. For QA: includes tasks to validate, quality standards, thresholds, Definition of Done, project root. Enables stateless agent invocation with complete context.

- **QA Report**: Structured JSON report generated by QA agent containing status (PASS/FAIL), summary metrics (tests, coverage, lint, type errors), detailed issues list (task, severity, type, description, location, recommendation), and Definition of Done checklist. Consumed by orchestrator to determine next actions (commit or rework).

- **Phase Plan**: Document presented by orchestrator before each phase execution containing objective, task list, dependency analysis, parallelization strategy, quality standards, and estimated time. Requires user approval before proceeding. Provides transparency and control over workflow execution.

- **Phase Completion Report**: Document presented by orchestrator after phase completes containing completion date, completed tasks, quality metrics, git commits, phase statistics (DEV agents invoked, QA validations, rework cycles, duration). Requires user approval before proceeding to next phase.

- **Workflow Orchestration Guide**: Section in CLAUDE.md providing detailed instructions to the main Claude agent on how to orchestrate the multi-agent workflow. Includes parallel execution strategy, dependency analysis, QA validation workflow, phase gate procedures, commit strategy, and context package formats. Supplements minimal Spec Kit integration directives.
