## Claude Code Sub-Agent Architecture

### What Are Sub-Agents?

Sub-agents are **specialized AI assistants within Claude Code** designed for specific tasks:

**Key Characteristics**:
- Operate in **separate context windows** (preserves main conversation context)
- Handle **specific types of tasks** with focused expertise
- Provide **reusable, configurable** AI assistants

**Configuration**:
- Defined in **Markdown files** with **YAML frontmatter**
- Can specify:
  - Name and description
  - Specific tools available
  - Model selection
  - System prompts/instructions

**Invocation Methods**:
1. **Automatic delegation**: Claude automatically routes tasks based on description
2. **Explicit invocation**: User/agent mentions the sub-agent by name
3. **Task tool invocation**: Use Task tool to invoke specific sub-agent

### Agent Architecture Core Loop

From Anthropic's engineering article, effective agents follow a feedback loop:

```
gather context → take action → verify work → repeat
```

**Context Management**:
- Agentic search through file systems
- Sub-agents for parallel information retrieval
- Compaction to manage long-term context limits

**Action Capabilities**:
- Custom tools for primary actions
- Bash/scripting for flexible interactions
- Code generation for complex tasks
- MCP for external service integration

**Verification Strategies**:
- Define clear rules
- Visual feedback (screenshots, outputs)
- Use additional LLMs as "judges"

### Sub-Agent Best Practices

1. **Create focused sub-agents** with clear, single responsibilities
2. **Write detailed system prompts** that define behavior
3. **Limit tool access** to only what's needed
4. **Version control** project-level sub-agents
5. **Chain multiple sub-agents** for complex workflows
6. **Dynamic selection** based on context

### Limitations

- May add latency (separate context window)
- Require careful configuration for optimal performance
- **Each sub-agent invocation is stateless** (no memory between calls)
- State must be managed externally by orchestrator

### Key Architectural Considerations

**Stateless Nature**:
- Each DEV invocation has no memory of previous calls
- State must be managed externally (by /implement or written to files)
- Context must be re-provided for each invocation

**Context Window Separation**:
- Main conversation preserved while DEV works
- DEV has its own token budget
- Results returned to main conversation

**Tool Scoping**:
- Can restrict DEV to only implementation tools (no web search, etc.)
- Ensures DEV stays focused on coding tasks

**Verification Loop**:
- DEV's "gather context → take action → verify work → repeat" aligns with Phase 5 workflow
- Can leverage DEV's internal verification before returning results

## Spec Kit Analysis

### Spec Kit Workflow vs DEV Agent Phases

| Spec Kit Command | DEV Agent Phase | Alignment Status |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `/constitution` | Foundation (Guardrails) | ✅ Already aligned |
| `/specify` | Phase 1: Understand | ✅ Already aligned |
| `/clarify` | Phase 1: Understand (refinement) | ✅ Already aligned |
| `/plan` | Phase 2: Plan | ✅ Already aligned |
| (implicit) | Phase 3: Iterate on Plan | ⚠️ Could be more explicit |
| `/tasks` | Phase 4: Document | ⚠️ Partial alignment |
| `/implement` | Phase 5: Implement | ❌ Missing quality loops |
| `/implement` (end) | Phase 6: Verify | ⚠️ Basic validation only |
| (missing) | Phase 7: Finalize | ❌ No user checkpoint |
| (missing) | Phase 8: Iteration | ❌ No feedback protocol |

### Critical Gaps in Current `/implement` Command

#### 1. Missing Per-Task Verification Loops

**Current behavior**: Execute task → mark complete → move to next task

**DEV agent behavior**: Execute subtask → verify acceptance criteria → verify quality standards → commit → repeat

**Impact**: No quality gates during execution, only at the end

#### 2. Missing Guardrails Enforcement

**DEV agent guardrails**:
- **NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Must meet all success criteria
- **NO SIMPLIFICATION EXCUSES**: No incomplete functionality
- **NO OVER-ENGINEERING**: Keep it simple
- **PRODUCTIVE ITERATION ONLY**: Stop after 2-3 failed attempts
- **FOLLOW EXISTING PATTERNS**: Analyze codebase first
- **STAY IN SCOPE**: No architectural decisions without approval

**Impact**: Without enforcement, agent can drift into over-engineering or partial implementations

#### 3. Quality Standards Specification

**What's needed**:
- **Testing**: Smart, meaningful tests that validate real behavior
- **Code Quality**: Linting, type checking, error handling
- **Documentation**: JSDoc/JavaDoc, inline comments explaining WHY
- **Version Control**: Atomic commits per subtask, clear messages

#### 4. Granularity Mismatch

- **Spec Kit tasks.md**: High-level tasks (T001, T002...) with phase grouping
- **DEV agent subtasks**: Fine-grained subtasks within each task, each with verification steps

**Solution**: `/implement` operates at task level, delegates to DEV for subtask-level execution

## Integration Model

### Sub-Agent Integration Architecture

```
/implement command (orchestrator)
    ↓
1. Load context (tasks.md, plan.md, spec.md)
2. For each task/phase:
    ↓
    Invoke DEV sub-agent with task context
        ↓ (separate context window)
        DEV executes: code → verify acceptance → verify quality → commit
        ↓
    Return results to /implement
    ↓
3. Aggregate results, mark tasks complete
4. Final verification & user checkpoint
```

### Benefits of Sub-Agent Approach

- ✅ **Separation of concerns**: /implement orchestrates, DEV executes with quality focus
- ✅ **Context preservation**: Main conversation preserved while DEV works
- ✅ **Reusability**: DEV can be invoked from other commands or directly by user
- ✅ **Tool scoping**: DEV gets only implementation tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash)
- ✅ **Clear responsibility**: DEV owns Phase 5-7 (Implement, Verify, Finalize)

### Context Package Design

**What /implement provides to DEV for each task**:
- Task ID, description, and file paths
- Subtasks as acceptance criteria
- Relevant spec requirements (FR-XXX references)
- Quality standards from plan.md (lint/type/test commands)
- Tech stack constraints
- Constitution guardrails

### Integration Approach: Minimal Directives

**Key Insight**: Don't rewrite commands. Just tell them to use the agent.

Instead of complex file merging:
1. Copy DEV agent to `.claude/agents/dev.md`
2. Add minimal directive to `/implement`: "For all task execution, invoke DEV sub-agent"
3. Add guidance to `/plan`: "Include quality standards section"
4. Add guidance to `/tasks`: "Use subtask format for acceptance criteria"

**Result**: Simple text insertion rather than command rewrites

## Key Design Decisions

### Distribution Model

**Decision**: Python package installable via uvx (like Spec Kit)

**Rationale**:
- Familiar pattern to Spec Kit users
- Python provides rich CLI libraries (click, typer)
- Excellent file manipulation and YAML/Markdown parsing
- Seamless integration with existing tooling

### Agent Storage

**Decision**: Flat `agents/` directory in library

**Rationale**:
- Simple, clear structure
- Easy to navigate
- Can refactor to categorized structure later if library grows
- Version management handled at package level

### Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Minimal directive insertion, not command rewrites

**Rationale**:
- 90% less complexity than full rewrites
- Preserves Spec Kit's existing logic
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and update
- Faster to implement (~4 hours vs days)

### Rollback Strategy

**Decision**: Automatic backup + dedicated rollback command

**Rationale**:
- Timestamped backups created before any changes
- `agents-library rollback` provides simple restoration
- All-or-nothing approach ensures consistent state
- No git knowledge required

### Validation Approach

**Decision**: Structural validation (YAML + required sections)

**Rationale**:
- Catches integration errors without test infrastructure
- Validates YAML frontmatter syntax
- Verifies required sections present
- Functional testing happens naturally during first use

## Evolution of Approach

### Initial Complex Approach (Archived)

- Complex file merging and customization detection
- Heuristic analysis for conflict resolution
- Interactive review of every change
- Manifest tracking and version management
- 21+ decision points
- ~2000+ lines of code
- Multiple days of implementation

### Simplified Approach (Current)

- Simple text insertion (minimal directives)
- Spec Kit detection and optional integration
- Backup/rollback capability
- Basic validation
- 5 key decisions
- ~300 lines of code
- ~4 hours of implementation

**Key Learning**: Complexity doesn't equal value. Simple, focused solutions are more maintainable and achieve the same core objectives.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Additional Agents**: QA, DOCS, REVIEW agents following same pattern
2. **Other Integrations**: Detection and integration with other frameworks beyond Spec Kit
3. **Agent Marketplace**: Centralized discovery of community agents
4. **Smart Updates**: Automatic detection of agent updates with changelog display

### Open Questions

1. How to handle agents that need to communicate with each other?
2. Should there be a standard protocol for agent context packages?
3. How to version agents independently from the library package?
4. What's the best way to share custom agents across teams?

## Conclusion

The research revealed that Claude Code's sub-agent architecture is the ideal foundation for integrating DEV's quality-focused methodology with Spec Kit's orchestration framework. The key insight was to keep it simple: agents define methodology, commands orchestrate, and minimal directives connect them.

**Core Finding**: Sub-agents operate in separate, stateless context windows. This means:
- State management is the orchestrator's responsibility
- Context must be re-provided for each invocation
- Integration is about delegation, not duplication of logic

**Recommended Architecture**: DEV as a sub-agent invoked by `/implement`, with minimal directive insertion rather than command rewrites. This achieves full integration with 10% of the complexity.
