# Comments and Feedback from user on Workflow Improvement Analysis

## Manual Observation & Root Cause Feedback

### Observation 1: No Phase-by-Phase User Verification

**User feedback**:
- Need to fix this - we cannot let the sub-agents run wild for too long without checking in

### Observation 2: Sequential Execution (No Parallelization)

**User feedback**:
- Need to fix this - we will get much more efficiency out of parallel sub-agent executions

## Research Findings

### Finding 1: Claude Code Supports Parallel Subagents

- We need to integrate this into our workflow. We can start with 3 parallel sub-agents, max

### Finding 2: Hooks Enable Deterministic Quality Gates

- I would love to integrate hooks into our workflow to get more strict workflow guidance
- We need to leverage hooks to enforce our workflow patterns, namely the verification process where we check that the sub-agents claims on its completion are accurate
- We can use these tools to absolutely verify that the quality and testing gates have been checked, as well as manual testing and any other checks we deem required

### Finding 3: Multi-Agent Verification Pattern Exists

- We should definitely configure this type of workflow where we have DEV and QA agents, each with specific definitions and roles, with the QA agents verifying the results of the DEV agents
- Expanding this, I like the idea of the parallel variant

### Finding 4: Context Isolation Improves Quality

- I agree we need to keep the sub-agent context windows small to make them extremely efficient, accurate, and precise

## Proposed Multi-Agent Architecture

- I LOVE this proposed multi-agent architecture - this is exactly what we're looking for
- This architecture diagram is amazing and shows exactly what we want

### Agent Roles

#### 1. **Orchestrator** (`/implement` command)

- Is this actually a sub-agent or is this the main claude code agent, which is running the orchestration flow through `/implement`?

#### 2. **DEV Agent** (Implementation specialist)

- Looks great except I don't think this agent should handle commits - if it handles commits it may commit incomplete code. I think we should leave the commits up to the orchestrator at checkpoints where the DEVs have completed a subset of work and the QAs have verified it.

#### 3. **QA Agent** (Verification specialist)

- I like the definition of this agent except we should make it clear that the agent needs to be project-agnostic - not every project it works on is going to a node project so we shouldn't have things like `npm test` and `npm run lint` in it's definition

## Hook-Based Quality Gates

- I agree we need a pre-commit hook as a final triple-checking of our quality standards before commit
- The SubagentStop hook is interesting because it seems like it might be doing the job that the QA agent would be doing, unless we are just using it as a way to check that the output of the DEV agent is formatted as we want.
- Phase gate check is probably a good idea, but again is this covering what the QA agent is meant to do?
- Are there any other hooks that make our defined workflow more sound?

---

## Parallel Execution Patterns

- Let's keep it to 3 DEV sub-agents parallel executions at one time
- Pattern 2 is not ok - we DO NOT want the DEV agents moving on if QA agents haven't completed previous verification
- I do like the idea of more specialized dev agents for front end and back end, but I want to keep it more simple for now, so just one dev agent

---

## Specific Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Create QA Agent

- I agree, let's create the QA Agent, following similar sub-agent definition patterns as the DEV agent

### Recommendation 2: Update `/implement` for Multi-Agent Workflow

- I'd like to try and be as uninvasive as possible when editing the Github Spec Kit commands, such as `/implement`. If we need to make changes, let's try to be very surgical with them, making them concise and targeted, and ideally self contained, so we aren't making changes all over the place

### Recommendation 3: Implement Quality Gate Hooks

- I like the idea of integrating hooks, but I want to make sure we are using hooks in the proper way and aren't having them do what the QA agent should be doing - if they can be used together, that works

### Recommendation 4: Enhanced DEV Agent Verification

- I agree DEV agent should be performing it's own initial verification

### Recommendation 5: Add Phase Gates to Orchestrator

- I agree we need Phase Gates, ideally using a hook

### Recommendation 6: Improve `/tasks` Subtask Format

- This is probably a nice way to create incremental verification points, but again, is the DEV agent running these verifications, or is this a back and forth between DEV and QA?

### Recommendation 7: Add `pantheon verify` Command

- A verify command is probably a good idea, if we want to run our own verification
