## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: Authentication token expiration duration is unspecified (FR-016). What is the exact token lifetime? ‚Üí A: Basic email-only identification (no passwords)
- Q: Concurrent update handling strategy is undefined (FR-045). How should the system handle two simultaneous updates to the same task? ‚Üí A: Last write wins (simpler, may lose data)
- Q: Performance targets are unspecified. What is the maximum acceptable response time for task operations? ‚Üí A: No specific target (best effort)
- Q: Database failure retry behavior is undefined (FR-043). How should the system respond to transient database failures? ‚Üí A: Immediate failure, no retries (client handles retry)
- Q: Graceful shutdown timeout is undefined (FR-052). How long should the system wait for in-flight requests to complete before forcing shutdown? ‚Üí A: No timeout (wait indefinitely for completion)
- Q: Project scope clarification ‚Üí A: Simple learning project - no scalability, rate limiting, or production-grade operational features required
- Q: Remove search functionality (FR-030, FR-031, FR-032, FR-033) to simplify project? ‚Üí A: Yes, remove all search requirements
- Q: Does this project require a front-end interface, or is it a backend-only REST API? ‚Üí A: Modern React-based front end required
- Q: How should the front-end communicate the user's email to the backend API for identification? ‚Üí A: Email entered once, maintained in session/cookies for subsequent requests
- Q: Should the React front-end and REST API backend be deployed together or separately? ‚Üí A: Monorepo structure but separate runtime - both in one codebase, deployed as separate services
- Q: Since front-end and backend run on separate ports, how should CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) be handled? ‚Üí A: Configure specific origin - only allow requests from front-end's URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- Q: How should users interact with due dates in the UI, especially regarding timezone handling? ‚Üí A: Date and time picker - captures both date and time in user's browser timezone

## Project Scope

**Learning Project**: This is a simple educational project focused on learning REST API fundamentals and modern React front-end development. Production concerns like scalability, high availability, advanced rate limiting, and complex operational monitoring are explicitly out of scope.

**Architecture**: Full-stack application organized as a monorepo with React-based front-end and REST API backend. Both components live in a single codebase but run as separate services (different processes/ports). The front-end consumes the backend API to provide a user interface for all task management operations.

**Target Use Case**: Single developer learning environment with minimal concurrent users. The system prioritizes learning value and code clarity over production readiness.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I need to manage my personal tasks through a web interface that allows me to create, organize, and track tasks with various properties. I should be able to categorize tasks by status and priority, organize them with tags, and set due dates using an intuitive visual interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I provide my email address, **Then** I can access the system
2. **Given** I am identified by email, **When** I create a task with a title, description, priority, and status, **Then** the task is saved persistently and I can retrieve it later
3. **Given** I have existing tasks, **When** I filter tasks by status or priority, **Then** I see only tasks matching those criteria
4. **Given** I have created tasks, **When** I update a task's properties, **Then** the changes are saved and the update timestamp reflects the modification
5. **Given** I have tasks with tags, **When** I apply or remove tags from tasks, **Then** the tag associations are maintained correctly
6. **Given** I have many tasks, **When** I request a page of results, **Then** I receive the specified number of tasks with pagination metadata
7. **Given** I want to delete a task, **When** I remove it, **Then** the task is permanently deleted from the system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user attempts to create a task with an invalid title (too long, empty, special characters)?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same task by the same user?
- What happens when pagination is requested beyond available pages?
- How does the system respond when a user tries to access a non-existent task?
- How does the system handle timezone differences for due dates?
- What happens when a user attempts to create duplicate tags?
- How does the system respond to malformed or missing email identification?
- What happens when database connections fail during operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Core Task Management**

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents an individual identified by unique email address (no password for POC). Each user owns their private collection of tasks and tags. Created timestamp tracks first access.

- **Task**: Represents a single work item or todo that belongs to a specific user. Contains descriptive information (title, description), organizational properties (status, priority), timing information (creation timestamp, update timestamp, optional due date with timezone), and can be associated with multiple tags. Tasks are completely isolated between users.

- **Tag**: Represents a user-defined label for organizing tasks. Each tag has a unique name within a user's account and can be applied to multiple tasks. Tags enable flexible categorization beyond the fixed status and priority fields.

- **Task-Tag Association**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between tasks and tags, allowing a task to have multiple tags and a tag to be applied to multiple tasks.
