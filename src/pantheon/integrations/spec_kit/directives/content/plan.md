## Quality Standards (Required for DEV Integration)

Include in plan.md output:
- Lint command (e.g., `npm run lint`)
- Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`)
- Test command (e.g., `npm test`)
- Coverage requirement (e.g., 80%)

If commands cannot be auto-discovered, mark as "CLARIFICATION REQUIRED".
