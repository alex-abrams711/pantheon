# PreCommit Hook - Quality gate before git commits
#
# This hook runs before git commits to ensure code quality.
# It validates:
#   1. Current phase has QA validated checkbox checked (if tasks.md exists)
#   2. Quality standards from .pantheon/quality-config.json pass
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Quality checks passed, allow commit
#   2 - Quality checks failed, block commit
