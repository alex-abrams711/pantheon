# Phase Transition Gate Hook - Validates phase transitions
#
# This hook runs on PreToolUse Task events before DEV agents are invoked.
# When orchestrator attempts to start a new phase, it validates:
#   1. Previous phase has "QA validated" checkbox checked
#   2. Previous phase has "User validated" checkbox checked
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Same phase or validation passed, allow task
#   2 - Phase transition blocked due to missing validation
